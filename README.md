# FoodFinder
FoodFinder is an android mobile application that can be used to book a table at a restaurant in any nearby college campus of the userâ€™s choice.

Target Application:
The application will be used by staff and students at any given university to find food joints near their respective schools. The users will be able to book a table (if available) at any place of their choice.
Features like getting directions to the restaurant, calling the restaurant helpline from the app directly implemented. 
Extra features that we plan to implement in the future are like showing food menu if available, facebook login and some UI based features.
